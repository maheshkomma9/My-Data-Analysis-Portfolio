üëã Hi, I'm **Mahesh** ‚Äì a recent Master's graduate in Data Science with a strong interest in **Data Analysis and Business Intelligence**.  
I enjoy working with data to uncover insights, build dashboards, and support decision-making.  

This portfolio highlights my projects in **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**, showcasing my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively.  
  
## üèè [IPL Stats Dashboard](./excel-IPL-stats-dashboard/README.md)

I created a dashboard using **Excel** where I:
