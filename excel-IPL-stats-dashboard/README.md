# 🏏 IPL Stats Dashboard (Excel + Power Query)

This project showcases an **interactive Excel dashboard** I created using **IPL statistics data**.  
The data was imported as a `.csv` file, cleaned and transformed using **Power Query**, and then visualized with Excel features such as **Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Charts**.
